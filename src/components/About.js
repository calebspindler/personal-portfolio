      <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="hideme">Hi, I'm Caleb Spindler! I am a web designer, developer, and content creator currently living in Louisville, KY. After completing two degrees in theology, I came across a long lost passion of mine for mixing creativity with technology.</p>
        <p class="hideme">Since then, I have completed the Front-End Web Development track and the Full-Stack JavaScript track at <a class="copy-link" href="https://codelouisville.org/">Code Louisville</a>, which have prepared me to code websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React). I am also enrolled in the Ruby on Rails track starting in January 2019.</p>
