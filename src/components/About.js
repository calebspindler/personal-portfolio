        <p>Hi, I'm Caleb Spindler! I am a web designer, developer, and content creator currently living in Louisville, KY. After completing two degrees in theology, I came across a long lost passion of mine for mixing creativity with technology.</p>
        <p>Since then, I have completed the Front-End Web Development track and the Full-Stack JavaScript track at <a class="copy-link" href="https://codelouisville.org/">Code Louisville</a>, which have prepared me to code websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React).</p>
        <p>When I'm not designing and developing websites, you'll probably find me spending time with my wife and son, hiking trails, traveling the globe, drinking good coffee, or eating Indian food.</p>
